#A Python Virtual Environment is an isolated space where you can work on your Python projects, separately from your system-installed Python. You can set up your own libraries and dependencies without affecting the system Python.

Virtual Enviroment Commands:-

    to create- python -m venv myenv

    to activate- myenv\scripts\activate

    to deactivate - deactivate

Here 'myenv' is the name of your virtual enviroment. You can name it as you wish.


#if there is restrictions on running virtual environment:-
